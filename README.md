### About me ðŸ‘‹

Things I love:

- **Robotics**: when I was a child, i wanted to build robot. This is what I do so... success!
- **C++ Programming**: I think I am quite good at it, but I ignore my current Dunning Kruger level.
- **Open Source**: I have few projects going on, mostly related to robotics. I like reporting bugs and sending PRs titled "Improved performance x%".
