### About me ðŸ‘‹

Things I love:

- **Robotics**: when I was a child, I wanted to build robots. This is what I do eventually so... success!
- **C++ Programming**: I think I am quite good at it. This is called "Dunning Kruger effect".
- **Open Source**: I have few projects going on, mostly related to robotics. I like reporting bugs and sending PRs titled "Improved performance x%".
